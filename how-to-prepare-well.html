            <h2>Do's and Don'ts</h2>
            <p>The following are some "do's" and "don'ts" when it comes to preparing for an exam!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sign-box">
        <div class="signs fade-in-right">
            <h3>Do's</h3>
            <p>1. Start early - Its never too early to start revising! It helps you retain more information. </p>
            <p>2. Find a work area where you can focus - It can be in a library or a study cafe.</p>
            <p>3. Create a schedule - Mark the dates where you will be having an exam.</p>
            <p>4. Start with what you enjoy or something that you need to get done immediately.</p>
            <p>5. Take breaks every now and then, don't overwork yourself!</p>
            <p>6. Ask for your teacher's assistance if there is any gaps.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="signs fade-in-left">
            <h3>Don'ts</h3>
            <p>1. Don't do all revision 1 day before the exam - Be realistic on how much you can do in a day!</p>
            <p>2. Don't procrastinate - As hard as it sounds, but imagine if you just studied a bit now and it have a greater effect later.</p>
            <p>3. Don't work in a noisy area - Avoid places where you can loose your focus easily, and as tempting as it may be avoid studying on your bed!</p>
            <p>4. Don't feel defeated! - Many students are experiencing the tension too, don't feel defeated now when there's still something you can do about it.</p>

            <h2>Active Learning vs Passive Learning</h2>
            <p>There is two type of learning you can familiar yourself with - active and passive learning. The two types have their own advantages and disadvantages. Familiarizing yourself with the type of learning may help you find your best revision plan</p>

      <div class="overcome-box">
            <div class="overcome fade-in-left">
                <h3>Active Learning</h3>
                <p>• Active learning requires practical work, deep discussions and critical thinking. It is surrounded by activities and normally need the learner to be actively engaged. Typically this work best when you are in a group setting</p>
                <p>• Subjects typically associated with active learning are Math, Physics, Chemistry etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="overcome fade-in-right">
                  <h3>Passive Learning</h3>
                  <p>•  Passive learning is instructor-based. This can be like attending a lecture, watching a video, and reading without needing to do pratical work or work that relies on critical thinking rather learner tries to internalize the information. Typically this passive learning do not require learner to be actively engaged.</p>
                  <p>• Subject typically associated with passive learning are History, Literature, Religious Studies etc.</p>
            </div>
      </div>
      <div class="fade-in-left"><p>	The 2 learning type have their own advantages and disadvantages. Typically when learning/revising it is best to use a mixture of both to fully master a concept/skill. Different subjects/type of exam also affect which type would work more effectively. If an exam/subject requires more critical thinking, it is more suitable to use active learning for instances. Ultimately it is what you believe and feel works best for you!</p></div>

              <h2>The Feynman Technique</h2>
              <p>Everyone probably have heard of the famous Feynman Technique, but if you haven't that's okay! Richard Feynman is a Theorical Physicists (A very hard subject FYI!) and received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965.

            <div class="signs fade-in-right">
              <h3>Step 1. Select the topic and map your knowledge</h3>
              <p>Write everything you know about the topic, then preferably with a different coloured pen add new information you learn on the topic from a new material such as video, textbook etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="signs fade-in-left">
              <h3>Step 2. Explain it to a 5-yr-old</h3>
              <p>After learning the topic with new information, act like you are teaching it to a younger audience like a 5-yr-old. Anyone can make a topic sounds complicated but only those who fully understands it can explain it in simple terms!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="signs fade-in-right">
                <h3>Step 3. Review and Refine</h3>
                <p>See where you have located gaps in Step 2. Once located go back to the material source and build a bridge from the gap and repeat till you feel confident with the topic.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="signs fade-in-left">
                <h3>Step 4. Test and Archive</h3>
                <p>You can test your understanding by attempting to teach the newly learnt topic to another person.</p>

              <h2>Remember, it takes trial and errors!</h2>
              <p>It is crucial to keep in mind that a technique that majority use will work the same for everyone. Trying to find the perfect method to revise will take trials and error, and that is totally normal. What's important is that you keep trying and put 100% effort because it will pay off in the end. Make sure you try your best and that you are happy with the effort you've put.</p>
