                <p>Change your perspective and view results as feedback, not as a reflection of your worth for future success. One set of results does not define you.</p>

                <h3>Focus on what you can control</h3>
                <p>Rather than focusing on the outcome, focus on the next steps you can take, whether it’s a merger, a new goal, or an alternative path.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="overcome fade-in-right">
