            <h2>What is choking?</h2>
            <p>Choking/blacking out is when we did bad or not perform up to our level due to stress, anxiety or pressure despite preparing well. Blacking out in exam is very common amongst students and should not be something to be ashamed of, rather something to tackle!</p>

            <h2>Difference between Choking and Blacking Out</h2>
            <p>Although there are differences between the two, their effect is not much different and significant.</p>

        <div class="signs fade-in-right">
            <h3>Choking</h3>
            <p>This happens when anxiety interferes with cognitive processes, making it difficult to remember information or make decisions. This often occurs in high-stakes situations such as exams, job interviews, or performances. Symptoms include:</p>
            <p>• Racing thoughts or overthinking</p>
            <p>• Confusion or feeling overwhelmed</p>
            <p>• Doubting your own knowledge</p>
            <p>• Making careless mistakes</p>
        </div>
        <div class="signs fade-in-left">
            <h3>Blacking out</h3>
            <p>Blackout is a more extreme reaction in which stress causes loss of short-term memory or an inability to concentrate. This occurs when the brain’s fight-or-flight response kicks in, restricting access to stored information. Symptoms include:</p>
            <p>• Not knowing what you used to know</p>
            <p>• Dizziness, lightheadedness, or disorientation</p>
            <p>• Difficulty concentrating on simple problems</p>

                <h3>Practice answering questions under exam conditions</h3>
                <p>Try to replicate the stress of a real exam during study sessions to get used to working under pressure. In a way it is training yourself so you feel comfortable in the real exam.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="overcome fade-in-right">
                  <h3>Use deep breathing and relaxation technique</h3>
                  <p>Try to breathe slowly or learn a mindfulness excercise (e.g. inhaling for four seconds and exhaling for six seconds). This can help to calm your nerves before and during the exam</p>
            </div>
            <div class="overcome fade-in-left">
                <h3>Start with easy questions first</h3>
                <p>Build confidence by answering what you know, then move on to more difficult questions later.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="overcome fade-in-right">
                <h3>Get enough sleep and eat well</h3>
                <p>Get at least seven to nine hours of sleep before the exam and eat a balanced diet to keep your brain sharp.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="overcome fade-in-left">
                <h3>Turn fear into excitement</h3>
                <p>Instead of thinking, “I'm nervous,” tell yourself, “I'm ready for this challenge” to stay positive.</p>

            <h2>What do I do if I choke or blackout in the exam?</h2>
            <p>Getting into this scenario in the exam may feel stressful and demotivating, that is why it is important to do everything you can in order to avoid it. On the other hand we do not know what the future holds for us. If you end up choking or blacking out, here are steps you can follow to recover:</p>
          <div class="ifchoke">
              <p>1. <b>Stop and Breathe –</b> Stop and take a slow, deep breath. Try the 4-7-8 breathing method (inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds). This helps calm the nervous system and delivers oxygen to the brain.</p>
              <p>2. <b>Calm Yourself –</b> If you’re feeling panicky, use the <i>5-4-3-2-1 technique</i>. The steps are name <i>5</i> things you can see, name <i>4</i> objects you can touch, name <i>3</i> things you can hear, name <i>2</i> things you can smell and lastly name <i>1</i> thing you can feel. This shifts your focus from panic to the present moment.</p>
              <p>3. <b>Skip and Go Back –</b> If your mind goes blank while answering a question, switch to an easier question to regain your confidence. When you come back later, this can help jog your memory.</p>
              <p>4. <b>Use a Brain Dump –</b> If you suddenly forget important information, write down everything you remember on a piece of scrap paper. Even small details can help jog your memory and regain your confidence.</p>
              <p>5. <b>Talk positively to yourself –</b> Instead of thinking, <i>"I failed,"</i> tell yourself, <i>"It's just a moment, I'll get through it."</i> Remind yourself that one difficult question won't determine your entire exam.</p>
