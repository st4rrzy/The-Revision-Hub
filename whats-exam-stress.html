          <h3>When the exam starts</h3>
          <p>- Get organized the night before (Don't try to cram everything in one night be realistic!)</p>

          <h3>Mentally</h3>
          <p>- Do Cognitive Reconstructing. Take notice when negative thoughts e.g. "I'm not smart enough" "What was I thinking when I choose this subject?". Those thoughts may amplify the stress, instead stop and try taking a different perspective.</p>
          <p>- Talk to someone! If the stress keep building up it may have worse effects on you in the end. Talking someone about feeling stress about exams can help tremendously and take off weight on your shoulders.</p>
